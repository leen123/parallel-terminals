# Parallel Terminals - Station Distribution

A C-based software project designed for managing terminals in a parallel computing environment. This project aims to manage multiple terminals collaboratively, distributing passengers among stations based on vehicle capacity and the number of passengers.

## Overview

The Parallel Terminals project is a software solution developed to manage multiple terminals simultaneously. It is built in C and designed to work in a parallel computing environment, where multiple computers collaborate to control and manage terminals efficiently.

## Features

- Parallel Terminal Management: The software allows the collaborative management of multiple terminals, ensuring efficient distribution of passengers among stations.

- Optimized Distribution: Passengers are distributed among stations based on factors such as vehicle capacity, the number of passengers, and station availability.

- Scalability: The project can be scaled to accommodate additional terminals and computing resources, making it suitable for various transportation systems.

## Usage

1. Compile the C source code using a C compiler such as GCC.
2. Set up your parallel computing environment, ensuring proper communication between terminals and computers.
3. Run the compiled program on each computer involved in managing terminals.
4. Monitor the system to observe the efficient distribution of passengers among stations.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Parallel Computing Environment (e.g., MPI)
- Multiple Computers (Nodes)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/leen123/parallel-terminals.git
2. Compile the C source code for each terminal and computer.
3. Set up the parallel computing environment.
4. Run the compiled program on each computer in your parallel system.
